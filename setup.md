You will need MATLAB to do this lesson. If you are an OSU faculty, staff or student, you have several options:
1. You can install MATLAB with an OSU license following the instructions in [https://is.oregonstate.edu/service/software/matlab](https://is.oregonstate.edu/service/software/matlab). 
2. You can access MATLAB without having to install it in your own computer using [Citrix](https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/citrix).
3. You can use one of the computers in the classroom. We will use [Citrix](https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/citrix)


You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using MATLAB:

1. Make a new folder on your Desktop called *matlab-novice-inflammation*.
2. Download [matlab-novice-inflammation.zip]({{ page.root}}/data/matlab-novice-inflammation.zip) and move the file to this folder.
3. Extract the zip archive. This will place all the data in the `matlab-novice-inflammation` directory.
   Note that on Windows, double-clicking on the zip file simply previews the contents: to extract, right-click and select **Extract All**
4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

	~~~
	cd Desktop/matlab-novice-inflammation/data
	~~~
	{: .bash}
